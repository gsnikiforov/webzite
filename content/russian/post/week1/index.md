## Overview

1. First off, instead of studying English, we were forced to dance and sing.

2. On Tuesday, I ate such a spicy shawarma, that I spent the whole Wednesday reabilitating from it.

3. On Thursday, we were trying to study a subject on Linear Algebra which no one understands. Even teachers.
