## Overview

LaTeX allows you to relatively easy type in wonderful looking math articles with astounding formulas and tables and layouts. It is pretty easy to download. Personally, I recommend using ![MikTeX,](https://miktex.org/) (located at https://miktex.org/ as of this day) as it is lightweight and resizable instrument to work with LaTeX.
