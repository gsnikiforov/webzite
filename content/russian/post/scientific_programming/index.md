## Overview

There are tons of zillions programming languages being used for scientific research. Just to name a few, it is C, C++, COBOL, Bash, C#, Dart, Java, Fortran, Julia, Kotlin, Lisp, Lua, PowerShell, Python, R, Ruby, Rust, SQl, Swift, Haskell, TypeScript.

Personally, I prefer C and C++, as they are universal and superiorly swift.
